\section{PROJECTS } \begin{enumerate}
  \item  {\large{\sl Automated Traffic Surveillance System}}\\
 Built a complete end-to end system which detects real time road offences and send the vehicle plate data to a database/website, we utilised the FR-CNN object detection model and various image processing techniques.\\
        - implemented the license plate extractor algorithm using morphological operations and other operations in opencv individually.\\
        -Developed the complete website using NodeJs which employed sockets to display offences in real time. Integrated maps in the application to monitor the physical location of the offence. Wrote python Script to pipeline data to the website after parsing and encoding
 \item {\large{\sl Activity Detection and Facial Recognition}}\\
 Developed a system to recognise the face of a person if human activity was detected and then log data to a database.\\
  	-Implemented the activity detector using background subtraction and detected Faces using haar cascades.\\
	-Recognised faces utilising the facenet neural network trained on CASIA-WebFace dataset.Image along with the identified name were stored in the database\\
	-Built using Opencv and Tensorflow in python.\\
